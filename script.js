"use strict"; //incorporating this 'expression' tells the browser to enable 'strict mode' - this mode helps ensure you write better code, for example, it prevents the use of undeclared variables.

//task 1 --------------
//task 1.1 - download and setup the starter code (this project) from GitHub to a suitable (and remembered) location
//task 1.2 - open the project (from its location) using a suitable editor (e.g., vscode or replit, etc)
//task 1.3 - generally review the html and css code/files (for quick reference; should be fairly clear based on work done to date)
//task 1.4 - review the js code to help ensure you understand what each line is and does (recapped from the earlier group review to help reenforce your own learning and understanding)
//task 1.5 - reflect on the terms 'abstraction' and 'decomposition' and create a general flow diagram (covered in week 1) to illustrate the codebase use of sequence, conditional (branching), looping (iteration) and function; ideally on paper – awareness of this will be highly useful as you progress through the week

//task 2 -------------- use the ideas of 'abstraction' and 'decomposition' when reflecting on the challenges of the following tasks
//task 2.1 - open and check the project (in this case the 'index.html' file) using the preferred browser, i.e., Chrome
//task 2.2 - implement the paint functions and debug any issue/s found; as suggested (in the brief) you will need to enable the developer tools – n.b., there are likely several layers of different problems; useful note: you can ignore any 'AudioContext' warning for the time being as we will discuss this later - however, in interested now please ask :)
//task 2.3 - expand the paint_assets function so that it draws a rectangle utilising the get_random function to position it dynamically at random positions within the defined canvas; start your research by searching “js random numbers”.  Once you developed and tested your ‘get_random’ function you will likely need to research (or recall) how to draw a rectangle with the p5 library; start your research by searching “p5 draw rectangle” - to complete this task you will likely need to combine your research and test your ideas
//task 2.4 - update the paint_background function so that the colour format uses 'integer' rgb values rather than 'hex'; start your research by searching "p5 set background color" *note ‘us’ spelling although it shouldn't make too much of a difference research-wise!

//task 3 (extended challenge) --------------
//task 3.1 - expand your 2.3 task so that your rectangle changes colour during each frame update; reflect on what you have done so far and consider and test ways this could be achieved and implemented as simply as possible
//task 3.2 - continue to expand your 2.3 (and now 3.1) task so that your rectangle cycles through all shades of the same colour (e.g., from the darkest to the lightest shade); reflect on what you have already completed and consider and test ways this could be achieved and implemented as simply as possible; for your recall and ease of reference, colour values start from 00 (darkest, i.e., no white added) to FF (lightest, i.e., full white added) in hex or 00 - 255 in decimal
